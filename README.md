- **Red-Black Tree Based Fast and Accurate Ray Tracing for Indoor Radio Wave Prediction**


### Abstract :

-  Ray tracing is a well-known technique to inves-
tigate the multipath propagation in the complex indoor
environment. However, it still suffers from the computa-
tion time and ray prediction accuracy for the complex
indoor environment. Therefore, three dimensional
(3D) ray tracing based on the Red-Black tree along with
object skipping and surface extraction techniques for the
complex indoor environment is presented in this project.
The Red-Black tree data structure provides a faster object
retrieval mechanism while object skipping technique pre-
vents the unnecessary objects to take part in intersection
tests, thus accelerates the ray tracing.  The obtained results show that the proposed method provides superior results.
